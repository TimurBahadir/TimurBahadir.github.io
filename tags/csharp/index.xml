      <description>For a game development class in university we had to create a game. In a team of three we decided to make use of the, at the time, new VR technology. In the game, the player is a student stuck inside a nightmare. He needs to defend himself from waves of university related utensils like books, paper airplanes and erasers. For each utensil that reaches the player he looses one life.</description>
