      <description>For university i went trough the process of learning OpenGL. I then compiled all the lessons i learned into a ~80 page long tutorial for other to read when they want to learn OpenGL. To improve upon the sources i used, i added multiple examples and many lines of code.
While reading and following the tutorial and examples a small but reuseable helper library is created, around the OpenGL-C-API, using modern C++.</description>

      <description>For a game development class in university we had to create a game. In a team of three we decided to make use of the, at the time, new VR technology. In the game, the player is a student stuck inside a nightmare. He needs to defend himself from waves of university related utensils like books, paper airplanes and erasers. For each utensil that reaches the player he looses one life.</description>
